# Automated State Testing Data Retrieval and Processing

This Python script automates the retrieval and processing of state testing data for the ELPAC (English Language Proficiency Assessments for California) and SBAC (Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium) and CAST (California Science Test). The script utilizes Selenium for web automation to log in to the testing portal, request specific reports, and download the corresponding data files. Once file are downloaded as zip files, the necessary data is extracted and stacked. The master tables are updated everyday after new records are merged up with the existing table to see what is coming in as new. 

* Master Table Names ELPAC_Scores, SBAC_Scores, CAST_Scores
* Incoming Record Table Names ELPAC_Scores_New, SBAC_Scores_New, CAST_Scores_New

## Overview

- **Log In and Navigation:** The script begins by logging in to the testing portal and navigating to the home screen.

- **Directory Setup:** It creates a directory structure for file downloads based on the current date, differentiating between ELPAC and SBAC data.

- **Chrome Options:** Chrome options are set for Selenium to manage download preferences and establish a specific download directory.

- **Request and Download Process:**
  - **SBAC:** The script requests the 'CAASPP Student Score Data Extract Report' for CAASPP coordinators, then downloads and processes the data files. Parameters within this function include School Year (SY), and By Enrolled of By Tested.
  - **ELPAC:** It requests the 'Student Score Data Extract Report' for ELPAC coordinators, then downloads and processes the corresponding data files. Parameters within this function include School Year (SY), and By Enrolled of By Tested.

- **Download Loop for Missing Files:** A loop is implemented to reattempt downloading in case of any missing files.

- **Unzipping and File Movement:** The script unzips the downloaded files and moves the XLSX files to the 'P:\Knowledge Management\Ellevation\Data Sent 2023-24\State Testing' directory.

## Usage

1. **Dependencies Installation:**
   - Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Provide your credentials in the `config.py` file (username, password).
   - Ensure the ChromeDriverManager is installed using `pip install webdriver_manager`.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script by running the main Python file.

4. **Output:**
   - The script logs its activities in 'ELPAC_SBAC_results.log'.
   - Downloaded files are stored in 'file_downloads' directory.
   - Unzipped and processed files are moved to 'P:\Knowledge Management\Ellevation\Data Sent 2023-24\State Testing'.

## Notes

- The script ensures that unique school names are considered when passing names into the requested reports.
- Directories are created dynamically based on the current date to organize downloaded files.
- Triggers exist for all three of the New Scores tables. SSID, TestType, TestName, & ScaleScore are partitioned over to identify duplicates as an extra layer of data integrity.
